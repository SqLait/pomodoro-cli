#+TITLE: Pomo

*Pomo* is a lightweight and customisable TTY pomodoro timer for Linux Mac BSD and Windows (git bash). It's written in pure bash, can track your progress and has a visually appealing TUI (take that GUI designers).

* Motive
During my internship I started to use the pomodoro technique for my work hours. The problem was is that there was not really a tool that would fit my niche.
The web versions required WiFi and overall felt overkill for what I really wanted to do, and existing CLIs did not have the features I cared about nor were customisable to change the timer in an easy manner.

Thus I recalled the age old saying:
